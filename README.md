# Authentication App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is created for [devChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/N1fvBjQfhlkctmwj1tnw)

## To Do
- [x] Login Page
- [x] Register Page
- [x] Hook Form
- [x] Redux
- [x] Implement register and login endpoints to backend 
- [x] Implement salt 
- [x] Add custom modals for the login and register pages
- [ ] Add tests for components
- [ ] Add test for api
- [X] User Page
- [ ] Edit Page
- [X] Style touches for buttons and forms
- [ ] Form validation on backend
- [X] Implement JWT

## Bugs

- [X] No access token is provided after register *Solved by providing jwt back after register to client*

   
## Security
*Unlike the salt and pepper, security is not in the table*

Even though salt is implemented, I would suggest that you sign up with fake e-mail and password.
